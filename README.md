🎨 Cartoon Face Project
Overview
This project is a fun and creative application that draws the face of one of my favorite childhood cartoon characters using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The unique feature of this project is that the face appears gradually when you click the "Draw Me" button.

It's a beginner-friendly project showcasing how JavaScript and CSS can be combined to create engaging animations and interactivity.
